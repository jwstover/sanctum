# Marvel Champions Online (Sanctum)

A web-based "smart table" for playing Marvel Champions: The Card Game online. It
provides digital deck and game-state management — zones, tokens, card states —
**without enforcing game rules**; players enforce the rules themselves. Built for
personal use, designed with room to grow into multiplayer.

## Rules for Working in This Repo

- **NEVER modify migrations manually.** Migrations are managed by Ash — generate
  them with `mix ash.codegen <name>`. The rare exception is framework-shipped
  migrations (e.g. an `Oban.Migration.up(version: N)` when bumping Oban across a
  schema version); those are added by hand deliberately.
- **Ash is the source of truth for the data layer.** Resources define attributes,
  relationships, actions, and policies. Don't hand-write Ecto schemas or raw SQL
  migrations to model domain data — change the resource and run codegen.
- **Single dark theme.** The UI is a pinned dark "comic-dossier" design. There is
  no light/dark toggle — do not reintroduce daisyUI theme switching.
- There are often several agents making changes and working in the single shared gitbutler workspace. Make sure that when you are committing your change you FIRST STAGE THE SPECIFIC HUNK and then review the staged changes before committing. We have already gotten into situations where work got mixed up. 

## Technical Stack

- **Backend**: Elixir/Phoenix, **Ash Framework** (resources, policies, actions)
- **Frontend**: Phoenix LiveView + Tailwind + custom JS hooks; self-hosted fonts
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (Neon in prod). The database is the authoritative source
  of state — there is no in-memory game process.
- **Real-time**: Phoenix PubSub
- **Background jobs**: Oban + AshOban
- **Deploy**: Fly.io (Depot builder), card images on a public Tigris S3 bucket

## Architecture

State lives in **Postgres, modeled with Ash resources**, and is rendered/mutated
directly by LiveViews. There is **no GenServer-per-game** — games are plain Ash
resources. PubSub broadcasts changes to connected clients. The only long-lived
process is `Sanctum.CardSync.Server` (drives MarvelCDB catalog sync).

### Ash Domains

| Domain | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `Sanctum.Accounts` | Users + tokens; auth (Google OAuth, magic link, password). `User.admin` boolean gates admin surfaces. |
| `Sanctum.Games` | Cards, card sides, scenarios, and live game state. The core domain. |
| `Sanctum.Decks` | Player decks imported from MarvelCDB; deck cards, aspects, uniqueness. |
| `Sanctum.Heroes` | Hero catalog (incl. `meta.colors`-derived gradient palette). |
| `Sanctum.Villains` | Villain catalog. |

### Card Data Model

MarvelCDB's card representation is normalized into:

- **`Card`** — the canonical card (`code`, `base_code`, `set`, `pack`,
  `deck_limit`, `unique`, `permanent`, `is_multi_sided`). Has many `card_sides`,
  a `primary_side`, many `alts`, and `many_to_many :decks`.
- **`CardSide`** — one face of a card (identity/alter-ego, main-scheme A/B, etc.).
  Holds the printed data: `name`/`subname`, `traits`, `type`, `ownership`,
  `aspect`, `text`, `image_url`, and the game stats.
- **`CardAlt`** — reprints. MarvelCDB's ~336 duplicate printings collapse into
  `CardAlt` rows pointing at the canonical `Card`; deck slots resolve reprint
  codes through the alt fallback.

Key type/field conventions:

- **`Stat`** (`Sanctum.Games.Stat`) — a **custom `Ash.Type`** (NOT an embedded
  resource) stored as jsonb: `%{value, star, scaling}`. Used for `attack`,
  `thwart`, `defense`, `health`, `recover`, and the threat stats. `cast_input`
  accepts a bare number or a map, so sync/fixtures/forms all work.
- **`CardOwnership`** enum (`:player | :basic | :pool | :hero | :encounter |
  :campaign`) and a separate nullable **`CardAspect`** enum (4 aspects only) —
  this replaced MarvelCDB's overloaded `faction_code`.

Live game state (`Game`, `GamePlayer`, `GameCard`, `GameVillain`,
`GameEncounterDeck`, `Scenario`, `ModularSet`): `GameCard` is the single
representation of an in-play card in any zone (main scheme, side scheme, player
area, etc.) — a prior separate `GameScheme` was folded into it.

## Subsystems

- **MarvelCDB sync** — `mix sanctum.sync_cards` / `mix sanctum.sync_decks` (dev)
  and `Sanctum.Release.sync_cards()` (prod, data-only). Card sync also runs
  interactively from the `/admin/cards/sync` admin LiveView, backed by
  `Sanctum.CardSync.Server` (GenServer + `Task` broadcasting throttled progress
  over PubSub). Sync groups payload entries per `base_code` to resolve sides
  (MarvelCDB's `linked_to_code` chains are incomplete). See `lib/sanctum/marvel_cdb.ex`.
- **Card images** — mirrored once from MarvelCDB into a public Tigris bucket
  (`sanctum-cards`); `card_sides.image_url` stores full bucket URLs. See
  `lib/sanctum/card_images.ex`.
- **Deck import** — decks come from MarvelCDB; Oban workers handle sync
  (`decklist_sync_worker`) and uniqueness computation (`compute_uniqueness_worker`).
- **Admin lockdown** — all `/admin/*` routes live in an `:admin_routes`
  live session behind a `:live_admin_required` on_mount hook (`User.admin`), plus
  admin-only Card/CardSide mutation policies (reads are open). The `/admin/oban`
  dashboard is the exception: Oban Web builds its own live_session (bypassing our
  on_mount), so it's gated by a `:require_admin` **conn plug** and served with a
  scoped nonce-based CSP (`:oban_csp`) that permits Oban's inline bootstrap script.
  Bootstrap the first admin with `Sanctum.Release.promote_admin(email)`. System
  writes (sync, seeds, deck import) run with `authorize?: false`.
- **Design system** — the pinned dark "comic-dossier" theme: self-hosted fonts,
  design tokens, halftone/offset-shadow utilities, an app shell, and the `mc_card`
  component. See `lib/sanctum_web/components`.

### Routes (authenticated)

- `/` — `GameLive.Index` (games list); `/games/new`, `/games/:id`
- `/cards` — `CardLive.Pool` (card browser, public read)
- `/decks`, `/decks/:id` — deck browser
- `/guess` — `GuessLive.Play` (card-guessing mini-game)
- `/admin` — `AdminLive.Index` (admin landing: system-health stats + links); the
  `/admin/cards*` management routes and `/admin/oban` — **admin only**

## Development Commands

The dev server runs on **port 4150** (not the usual Phoenix `4000`) — reach it at
`http://localhost:4150`.

```bash
mix setup                    # deps, database, assets
iex -S mix phx.server        # dev server with console (http://localhost:4150)

mix ash.codegen <name>       # generate migrations after resource changes
mix ash.setup                # set up Ash resources + database
mix ecto.reset               # drop + recreate database

mix sanctum.sync_cards       # sync card catalog from MarvelCDB (dev)
mix sanctum.sync_decks       # sync decks from MarvelCDB (dev)

mix test                     # test suite (runs ash.setup quietly)
mix ck                       # format + Credo + Sobelow (run before committing)
mix format                   # format only
mix dialyzer                 # static analysis (PLTs in priv/plts/)
```

## Running MarvelCDB Locally

MarvelCDB's source ([zzorba/marvelsdb](https://github.com/zzorba/marvelsdb), PHP
7.4/Symfony 3.4) is cloned at `~/code/marvelsdb` with a dockerized dev setup we
built (fork: `jwstover/marvelsdb`). Useful for testing sync behavior against a
local instance or preparing upstream API fixes.

```bash
cd ~/code/marvelsdb
git switch feat/docker-dev-setup                 # branch with the docker env
docker compose up                                # http://localhost:8000; first run imports the card catalog
docker compose exec app php bin/console app:seed:dev   # fake users/decklists/votes/comments (branch feat/dev-seed-command)
```

Gotchas learned setting it up: the card importer needs `memory_limit=1G`; the
`website_url` parameter is a bare i18n routing hostname (`localhost`), not a URL;
requires Composer 1 and MySQL 8.0. `docker compose down -v` resets the database.

Upstream fix branches on the fork (PRs not yet opened): `feat/decklist-api-social-counts`
(adds `like_count`/`favorite_count`/`comment_count` to the decklist API — the public
API doesn't expose likes otherwise), `fix/by-date-empty-500` (the `by_date` 500 on
empty days that `decklists_endpoint_healthy?` in `lib/sanctum/marvel_cdb.ex` works
around), `feat/dev-seed-command`, and `feat/docker-dev-setup`.

## Dev Dashboards

- `/dev/dashboard` — Phoenix LiveDashboard (dev only)
- `/admin/oban` — Oban job monitoring (**admin only, available in prod**)
- `/admin/ash` — AshAdmin resource management (dev only)
- `/dev/mailbox` — email preview

## Notes

- **Detailed decision history** (entity redesigns, card model v2, image sourcing,
  admin lockdown, design migration, CI/deploy fixes) lives in the Obsidian vault
  under `01 - Projects/Personal/Sanctum/` — consult it before large changes rather
  than duplicating that context here.
- Auth: Google OAuth registration is **open** (any Google account can sign in), so
  authentication ≠ trust — the `User.admin` flag is what gates privileged surfaces.
- `docs/card_fields.md` and `docs/card_model_v2.md` document the card data model
  and its most recent redesign.
- Test your changes using the playwright-cli against the running dev server at localhost:4150
